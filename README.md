Week 3 HW
Hi AK, as per our conversation in Saturday's class there was some formatting bug issue when uploading my HW to github for some of the tables. As per your suggestion I googled to see if I can find a resolution but I couldn't. Hopefully this doesn't negatively effect my grade for this homework. If you were to import all of the code to a jupyter notebook these formatting issues don't exist.
